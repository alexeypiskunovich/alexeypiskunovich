Welcome to my frontend development portfolio! ðŸ‘‹

In this repository, you will find a collection of projects showcasing my skills and expertise in frontend development. Each project demonstrates different aspects of my work, including web design, user interface development, and interactive features.
I am a second-year student at the Polotsk State University named after Euphrosyne of Polotsk, majoring in Software Engineering. In addition to the university curriculum, I am deeply involved in frontend development, which has interested me since high school. My technology stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Material UI, and Ant Design. Furthermore, I have experience working with C++, C#, and Python based on the university program.
